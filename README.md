# Rulox Interpreter
Rulox is an imperative, dynamically typed scripting language with C-like syntax based mainly on the Lox programming language found in the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Bob Nystrom. The Rulox interpreter can either be run from the command line as a REPL or compiled to WebAssembly and intergrated into the browser.

Currently this project is divided into three workspaces: `rulox-core` (the core interpreter), `rulox-cli` (a command line REPL), and `rulox-web` (a WebAssembly compilation for a simple web interface).
