# Rulox Interpreter
Rust implementation of the Lox language interpreter found in the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Bob Nystrom.

Currently this project is divided into three workspaces: `rulox-core` (core interpreter library), `rulox-cli` (command line interpreter and REPL), and `rulox-web` (Web Assembly compilation for a simple web interface).
